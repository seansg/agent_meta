# ADK Tool Scaffold Skill

This skill automates the creation of standard `BaseTool` implementations for the Agent Development Kit.

## Instructions

1. **Identify the Tool Name**:
   Extract the name of the tool the user wants to build (e.g., "StockPrice", "EmailSender").
   
2. **Review the Example**:
   Check `examples/WeatherTool.py` to understand the expected structure of an ADK tool (imports, inheritance, schema).

3. **Run the Scaffolder**:
   Execute the python script to generate the initial file.
   
   ```bash
   python scripts/scaffold_tool.py <ToolName>
   ```

4. **Refine**:
   After generation, you must edit the file to:
   - Update the `execute` method with real logic.
   - Define the JSON schema in `get_schema`.
   
## Example Usage
User: "Create a tool to search Wikipedia."
Agent: 
1. Runs `python scripts/scaffold_tool.py WikipediaSearch`
2. Editing `WikipediaSearchTool.py` to add the `requests` logic and `query` argument schema.
